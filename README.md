  Unlock is a protocol for memberships which lets creators monetize their work,
  on their own terms, without having to rely on 3rd party applications or
  platform.
  
  Unlock is a flexible web3 protocol that allows you to put a “lock” on certain features on your site. It’s powered by NFTs that verify memberships. A single NFT can be used to allow access to multiple areas and groups, regardless of whether they are on the web or in the physical world. This means that Unlock can be used to group together formerly distributed fanbases, or accept and verify tickets to events and venues.

# Introduction

We believe the web is [moving away from attention](https://medium.com/unlock-protocol/the-end-of-the-ad-supported-web-d4d093fb462f) as its business model toward memberships as a way for creators to charge for access to their community, their content or the applications they provide.

Yet, most websites are moving to memberships with their own system which creates a lot of friction for them \(adding user accounts, supporting credit payments...\) and for their users.

With Unlock, we believe there is a better way, which reduces friction, increases conversion rate and reduces prices while aligning interests between creators and consumers!

## For Creators

As a creator, you want to monetize your work and ensure that only your _members_ can access it. For this you should create a Lock. The lock is a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain which defines the terms of your membership. The Lock is yours and cannot be modified by anyone else, unless you grant them the permission.

The lock itself does not _know_ about the content or features which it locks. The lock is also completely decoupled from your application, which means that it can be implemented in many different contexts: on the front-end, on the back-end, inside of chat applications, or even in other smart contracts.

## For Consumers

As consumers, you want to easily unlock access to your favorite websites, or be part of communities. Unlock represents these memberships as [Non Fungible Tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token). These tokens are directly linked to your Ethereum wallet. If you do not have a wallet, or do not care about owning one, you should consider our Unlock User accounts which make it trivial for anyone to unlock content with their credit cards.

We also built a [_keychain_](https://app.unlock-protocol.com/keychain/) \_\_for consumers to easily view all of their memberships and use them. This involves cancelling them, transferring them or printing codes to assert ownership \(very useful for tickets!\)
